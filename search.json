    "text": "This comprehensive user guide for the Carolinas Regional Explorer application, hosted at https://regionalexplorer.netlify.app/, is designed to assist users in navigating its features, exploring data relationships, and analyzing spatial patterns. The application is part of the Carolinas Regional Explorer project, a web-based interactive data platform developed by the UNC Charlotte Urban Institute, seeking to present neighborhood-level data on public life across 14 counties surrounding Mecklenberg County. These counties include Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Union, Stanly, Rowan, Iredell, Catawba, Lincoln, Gaston, Anson, Cleveland, York (SC), Chester (SC), and Lancaster (SC). Modeled along the lines of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Quality of Life Explorer (Quality of Life Explorer), the regional explorer expands the spatial footprint to serve the region and offers enhanced features to understand regional growth dynamics.\nThe guide is divided into three sections, each addressing specific tools and features, with detailed instructions and interpretations for effective use."

    "text": "Using the Navigation features\n\nOn the top left of the explorer are a set of navigation features.\n\nBelow the zoom in and zoom out buttons, the Home button allows users to return the map to its default extent. This is especially useful after zooming in or selecting a city or county from the search bar.\nThe next button is a basemap selector. Choose from a list of basemaps that suit your purpose and preference.\nThe cross button below is to clear selection. When a city or county is selected, their boundaries are highlighted in red. This button will clear any selection made on the map.\nThe zoom button below zooms to a selected city or census tract or county. This is useful when one arbitrarily zooms out of a selected feature but wants to return to the default extent of a city or a county.\nThe eye button toggles between the explorer and the base map. This is useful when investigating the exact location of a census tract."

For instance, one variable uses shades of blue (light to dark for low to high), and another shades of red, with the resulting color on the map being a mix showing intermediate values.\nThis visualization helps identify correlations, such as areas with high values in both variables appearing in darker shades, across the region."

Simultaneously, the high values along these axes also represent the low values of the other variables and vice versa.\nColors in the top and bottom corner of the square represent areas with high values in both variables and areas with low values in both variables respectively."

Be cautious, as correlation does not imply causation, and clusters may reflect underlying factors not shown in the data."
